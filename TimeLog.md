#### Day's Reflection:
I have decided to start including this in my time log rather than posting my reflections in Github issues for
the sake of consolidating into one place. Thus far, I have not had a lot of time to work on my individual
project, and even when I have had time I have had a little trouble getting going on it because it is easy to
push aside in favor of the weekly work. So this week onward, I am going to actively strive to make sure that
project tasks get worked into the weekly class work so that I don't get irreparably behind.

I have done some planning thus far on my project, but a lot has been abstract thought and brainstorming while in the
car or otherwise not at a computer to put together a solid plan, so trying to put everything together for this first
checkpoint has been a bit of a task. Unfortunately I'm not quite there yet, but hope to be by EOD tomorrow for sure.

### <a id="009"></a>2022.02.10 - Individual Project
- Project work
  - Update README
  - User Stories
#### Day's Reflection:
Some things came up at home and I had to step away for the rest of the day, so I was not able to get nearly as much 
time in as I had hoped. I have a busy weekend, so I am hoping to be able to carve out as much time today (2/11) as 
possible 
to get some project planning done.

### <a id="010"></a>2022.02.11 - Individual Project
- Project work
  - Screens
#### Day's Reflection:
I got a great start on my screens today. Just have to finish those up and work on the project plan. No real snags,
just need the time to get it done.
