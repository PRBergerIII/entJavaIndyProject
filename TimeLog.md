#### Day's Reflection:
I have decided to start including this in my time log rather than posting my reflections in Github issues for
the sake of consolidating into one place. Thus far, I have not had a lot of time to work on my individual
project, and even when I have had time I have had a little trouble getting going on it because it is easy to
push aside in favor of the weekly work. So this week onward, I am going to actively strive to make sure that
project tasks get worked into the weekly class work so that I don't get irreparably behind.

I have done some planning thus far on my project, but a lot has been abstract thought and brainstorming while in the
car or otherwise not at a computer to put together a solid plan, so trying to put everything together for this first
checkpoint has been a bit of a task. Unfortunately I'm not quite there yet, but hope to be by EOD tomorrow for sure.

### <a id="009"></a>2022.02.10 - Individual Project
- Project work
  - Update README
  - User Stories
#### Day's Reflection:
Some things came up at home and I had to step away for the rest of the day, so I was not able to get nearly as much 
time in as I had hoped. I have a busy weekend, so I am hoping to be able to carve out as much time today (2/11) as 
possible 
to get some project planning done.

### <a id="010"></a>2022.02.11 - Individual Project
- Project work
  - Screens
#### Day's Reflection:
I got a great start on my screens today. Just have to finish those up and work on the project plan. No real snags,
just need the time to get it done.

### <a id="011"></a>2022.02.14 - Individual Project
- Project work
  - Screens
#### Day's Reflection:
Unexpectedly cut short again.

### <a id="012"></a>2022.02.15 - Individual Project
- Project work
  - Screens
  - Screen md file
  - Project plan
#### Day's Reflection:
I finally was able to sit down and really get rolling and finish up for my 1st checkpoint. The only part I'm not too 
sure about is the project plan. I have a vague framework set up for now, but without really knowing what some of the 
future concepts entail, it is hard to make any detailed plans that far out. My goal is to update the plan weekly to 
a) account for new concepts and technologies, and b) adjust as needed as I build out the project.

### <a id="013"></a>2022.02.24 - Week 4
- Readings

#### Day's Reflection:
I was already playing catch-up, and the last 7 days put me even further behind, but I am at least back at it. This 
weekend is going to be a marathon.

### <a id="014"></a>2022.02.26 - Individual Project
- Project organization
- Pom file setup
- Group meeting for peer reviews

#### Day's Reflection:
I got a good amount of infrastructure in place on my project, so this is a good step in the right direction. I still
have some weekly work catchup to do, which will help integrate the newer concepts into the project work. There are
still some aspects of the design I need to polish up, and I will get working on database design next. Overall I feel
like I am making progress.

### <a id="015"></a>2022.02.27 - Week 4 / Code Reviews
- Peer code reviews
- Videos

#### Day's Reflection:
It was good to go through other people's projects and see how others are approaching it. I think trying to find room
for improvement in others' work helps to find it in my own. It's also a nice way to find alternate (and better!)
ways of doing things.

### <a id="016"></a>2022.03.02 - Week 4
- Videos
  - Followed along with hibernate demos

#### Day's Reflection: 
Had to do a lot of refactoring to make the hibernate stuff work because I had the exercise set up a bit differently, but I think it was good to work through how I could get everything working together. I am having trouble with the database dump, and have run in circles long enough that I think I need a brain break and will try again in the morning.

### <a id="017"></a>2022.03.02 - Week 4
- Get mysqldump working
- Finish Hibernate Demos
- Work on Exercise
  - Had an interesing conundrum with PropertiesLoader... I tried to replace the print statements in the default method, but since it is an interface, I couldn't make a private logger like in a class. I found [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/68458037) on a similar question on SA, and I thought that was a good way to work around it, but not sure it is the best way to do it. Thoughts?

#### Day's Reflection: 
Definitely needed a brain break. I found the mysqldump issue, I just had to locate the .exe on my system. Took a 
minute or two and smoe googling but I found it. Then I had some trouble getting the tests to use the correct 
database, but once I watched that last week 4 video about adding a different hibernate config file in the test 
directory, that was easily sorted. 

I wrestled for a WHILE with two nullpointerexceptions. One was because I was missing the "/" in front of the path name for my database.properties file for the Database test class, and the other was because when I changed Database over to implement PropertiesLoader, I forgot to actually assign the results of LoadProperties to the properties file. I still can't figure out how my tests were actually passing, though. It makes it seem like maybe the Hibernate config was filling in the gaps?

By the time I got to the exercise, I was feeling pretty good about all the hibernate stuff. I think the exercise itsef went pretty smoothly, especially compared to the demos. I think part of it was that my user display demo project has gotten pretty sloppy, but just in general I felt like I hit a lot of road blocks for this week's material. Like I said though, the exercise went much more smoothly, so I'm feeling good about getting more into hibernate ~~next week~~ tomorrow.
