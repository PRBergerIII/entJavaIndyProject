#### Day's Reflection:
I have decided to start including this in my time log rather than posting my reflections in Github issues for 
the sake of consolidating into one place. Thus far, I have not had a lot of time to work on my individual 
project, and even when I have had time I have had a little trouble getting going on it because it is easy to 
push aside in favor of the weekly work. So this week onward, I am going to actively strive to make sure that
project tasks get worked into the weekly class work so that I don't get irreparably behind.

I have done some planning thus far on my project, but a lot has been abstract thought and brainstorming while in the 
car or otherwise not at a computer to put together a solid plan, so trying to put everything together for this first
checkpoint has been a bit of a task. Unfortunately I'm not quite there yet, but hope to be by EOD tomorrow for sure.
