#### Day's Reflection:
I have decided to start including this in my time log rather than posting my reflections in Github issues for
the sake of consolidating into one place. Thus far, I have not had a lot of time to work on my individual
project, and even when I have had time I have had a little trouble getting going on it because it is easy to
push aside in favor of the weekly work. So this week onward, I am going to actively strive to make sure that
project tasks get worked into the weekly class work so that I don't get irreparably behind.

I have done some planning thus far on my project, but a lot has been abstract thought and brainstorming while in the
car or otherwise not at a computer to put together a solid plan, so trying to put everything together for this first
checkpoint has been a bit of a task. Unfortunately I'm not quite there yet, but hope to be by EOD tomorrow for sure.

### <a id="009"></a>2022.02.10 - Individual Project
- Project work
  - Update README
  - User Stories
#### Day's Reflection:
Some things came up at home and I had to step away for the rest of the day, so I was not able to get nearly as much 
time in as I had hoped. I have a busy weekend, so I am hoping to be able to carve out as much time today (2/11) as 
possible 
to get some project planning done.

### <a id="010"></a>2022.02.11 - Individual Project
- Project work
  - Screens
#### Day's Reflection:
I got a great start on my screens today. Just have to finish those up and work on the project plan. No real snags,
just need the time to get it done.

### <a id="011"></a>2022.02.14 - Individual Project
- Project work
  - Screens
#### Day's Reflection:
Unexpectedly cut short again.

### <a id="012"></a>2022.02.15 - Individual Project
- Project work
  - Screens
  - Screen md file
  - Project plan
#### Day's Reflection:
I finally was able to sit down and really get rolling and finish up for my 1st checkpoint. The only part I'm not too 
sure about is the project plan. I have a vague framework set up for now, but without really knowing what some of the 
future concepts entail, it is hard to make any detailed plans that far out. My goal is to update the plan weekly to 
a) account for new concepts and technologies, and b) adjust as needed as I build out the project.

### <a id="013"></a>2022.02.24 - Week 4
- Readings

#### Day's Reflection:
I was already playing catch-up, and the last 7 days put me even further behind, but I am at least back at it. This 
weekend is going to be a marathon.

### <a id="014"></a>2022.02.26 - Individual Project
- Project organization
- Pom file setup
- Group meeting for peer reviews

#### Day's Reflection:
I got a good amount of infrastructure in place on my project, so this is a good step in the right direction. I still
have some weekly work catchup to do, which will help integrate the newer concepts into the project work. There are
still some aspects of the design I need to polish up, and I will get working on database design next. Overall I feel
like I am making progress.

### <a id="015"></a>2022.02.27 - Week 4 / Code Reviews
- Peer code reviews
- Videos

#### Day's Reflection:
It was good to go through other people's projects and see how others are approaching it. I think trying to find room
for improvement in others' work helps to find it in my own. It's also a nice way to find alternate (and better!)
ways of doing things.

### <a id="016"></a>2022.03.02 - Week 4
- Videos
  - Followed along with hibernate demos

#### Day's Reflection: 
Had to do a lot of refactoring to make the hibernate stuff work because I had the exercise set up a bit differently, but I think it was good to work through how I could get everything working together. I am having trouble with the database dump, and have run in circles long enough that I think I need a brain break and will try again in the morning.

### <a id="017"></a>2022.03.03 - Week 4
- Get mysqldump working
- Finish Hibernate Demos
- Work on Exercise
  - Had an interesing conundrum with PropertiesLoader... I tried to replace the print statements in the default method, but since it is an interface, I couldn't make a private logger like in a class. I found [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/68458037) on a similar question on SA, and I thought that was a good way to work around it, but not sure it is the best way to do it. Thoughts?

#### Day's Reflection: 
Definitely needed a brain break. I found the mysqldump issue, I just had to locate the .exe on my system. Took a 
minute or two and smoe googling but I found it. Then I had some trouble getting the tests to use the correct 
database, but once I watched that last week 4 video about adding a different hibernate config file in the test 
directory, that was easily sorted. 

I wrestled for a WHILE with two nullpointerexceptions. One was because I was missing the "/" in front of the path name for my database.properties file for the Database test class, and the other was because when I changed Database over to implement PropertiesLoader, I forgot to actually assign the results of LoadProperties to the properties file. I still can't figure out how my tests were actually passing, though. It makes it seem like maybe the Hibernate config was filling in the gaps?

By the time I got to the exercise, I was feeling pretty good about all the hibernate stuff. I think the exercise itself went pretty smoothly, especially compared to the demos. I think part of it was that my user display demo project has gotten pretty sloppy, but just in general I felt like I hit a lot of road blocks for this week's material. Like I said though, the exercise went much more smoothly, so I'm feeling good about getting more into hibernate ~~next week~~ tomorrow. This material took me longer than I was hoping, and I feel like I had to fight through a lot, but I'm hoping if I can get better consistency in working on this class that will help.

### <a id="018"></a>2022.03.05 - Week 5
- Readings (I need to learn to watch your overview videos before I do the readings so when you say things like "you don't have to read this cover to cover, this is more a reference", I haven't already read through it cover to cover...)
- Videos
  - Follow along with demo

#### Day's Reflection: 
Everything went pretty smoothly working through the demo and getting the hang of the table relationships.

### <a id="019"></a>2022.03.06 - Week 5
- Videos
  - Get orders showing up on JSP table
  - Work through .equals video and add to exercise 4
- Exercise 5


#### Day's Reflection: 
In messing around with adding .equals to my tests in the week 4 exercise, I asumed the insdert test would fail because of the ID comparison, and it didn't. Digging around with the debugger, I realized that the insert method appears to also update the id in the object itself, not just in the DB table, which is pretty cool. Not sure how obivous this should have been, but I don't remember it being explicitly stated anywhere, so it was a nice aha moment that demonstrates how the entities and their representation in the database are so tightly linked. 

I got the generic DAO working on my week 4 exercise, but I was getting a warning: `Raw use of parameterized class 'GenericDao'`, so I looked that up and what I basically found was that if I declare the variable as `GenericDao<Book> genericDao;` instead of `GenericDao genericDao;`, this warning goes away. This also prevents the need for casting `getById()` as a book. So I guess I'm wondering why I don't just declare it as a DAO for books at the setup, since this particular test class is just for books anyway, and presumably each test class would have a specific entity it is testing. I'm also curious about the difference between `T` and `type` in the generic DAO class, and can't seem to wrap my head around it. Are they not both Class objects?

Oh and I played around with branching in Ex4, so that was cool. 

Really having some aha moments with hibernate. This week's exercise helped clear up some of what is going on behind the scenes. For instance, I couldn't figure out how the set of books was being populated, but now I understand that is what the @OneToMany tag is doing. Effectively telling hibernate "Store the books that reference this author as a foreign key here". ...Right? Anyway, I do feel pretty good about all this DAO business, and am looking forward to (eventually) getting all this stuff looped into my project. 

### <a id="020"></a>2022.03.27 - Week 6
- Readings
- Videos
- Set up AWS
  - Open AWS account
  - Configure the user display exercise on AWS
  - Add cost notifications
- Set up beat box project in IntelliJ for professional development project
  
#### Day's Reflection: 
So I hate to even put this in writing for fear of everything falling apart, but getting the user display exercise up and running on AWS actually went very smoothly, and I only had one or two minor hiccups that were really just typos basically. After a long hiatus of any meaningful progress in this course, it was nice to get up and running in AWS pretty painlessly. I also connected to the sample database on AWS with intellij, which will probably come in handy. 

### <a id="021"></a>2022.04.05 - Team Project
- Team Project
  - Create database

#### Day's Reflection: 
I didn't write my prettiest code today, but it got the job done. Our team found a website with an extensive list of music genres so after copying the html for the list and a little bit of manual cleaning, I used it to form the SQL that will build the database. I threw together some javasript to pull all of the list elements out of the UL, keep track of the parent, and create an insert statement with its name and parent ID (if it had one). It took a bit of beating my head against the wall and I'm sure there is a cleaner way to do what I needed but all I needed it to do was create the script accurately, and it did, so I'll take it.

### <a id="023"></a>2022.04.10 - Branching / Team Project / Week 7
- Branching exercise
- Readings
- Cognito overview video
- Team meeting

#### Day's Reflection: 



### <a id="024"></a>2022.04.13 - Team Project
- Team project
  - Error handling
  - Record presentation with group
  - Post video link
  - Update student directory to reflect finished project

#### Day's Reflection: 
Today our team wrapped up the team project. I think it was a valuable exercise in communication and division of tasks for a project. Over the course of the weeks, we got into the swing of developing in out own branches, making pull requests, and keeping from stepping on each other's commits, which was great. 

### <a id="026"></a>2022.04.23 - Lots of stuff
- Branching Exercise
  - Finished up the last portion of the programmer 2 track
- AWS stuff
  - Create new environment with better naming to allow for multiple apps
  - Get user display exercise working on new env
  - Terminate old env
  - Add Database and configure for team project
  - Get team project up and running in AWS alongside the user display exercise
- Week 7
  - Set up cognito
  - Complete the week 7 exercise
- Week 8
  - Readings

#### Day's Reflection: 
So far today I have done a lot with AWS. I cloned my beanstalk instance and created a new one with a better name that lends itself to acommodating multiple apps. Getting them both to run in there was actually pretty painless once the databases were set up and talking and all the configuration files were properly set up with new urls and such. From what I can tell, this won't incur any additional charges, so that's cool too. Working through the cognito user pool exercise went pretty smoothly, and I plan to look at the next steps after pushing this update and putting up an issue for the assignment. Honestly I will probably hold off on implementing any of that stuff on this exercise and will instead look into how to implement them in my indy project. Key learning points were really just how easy it is to set up authentication though cognito. Definitely need to do a bit more digging into the actual code that was provided, but I have a general idea of how things are passed around. Haven't run into any problems today other than I had a weird SQL exception when I first put the team project up on AWS, but when I looked it up I found out that it could be a result of an incorrect password or otherwise incorrect properties file, and it was just a typo in the DB url, so that was an easy fix.

### <a id="027"></a>2022.04.24 - Week 8,
- Week 8
  - More readings
  - Videos
  - Activities
  - Exercise
    - Used [this page](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/tutorial/jaxrs-client003.htm) to figure out how to add headers to the API request

#### Day's Reflection: 
Everything went pretty smoothly with all of this stuff. The only hiccup I had was figuring out how to deal with the fact that my chosen api required both query parameters and a key in the headers, but nothing a bit of googling couldn't solve.
