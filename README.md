# Paul Berger Independent Project

Problem statement:

This project seeks to take some of the hassle out of holiday and special occasion shopping. Gift registries are largely dependent on retailers, which often leads to a person, couple, or family having multiple registries to cover everything they would like. There are several registries that can aggregate these into one, but these are often tailored specifically to weddings or baby showers, and  the items are still tied to specific retailers. This creates the problem of a gift buyer finding a matching gift, but not being able to take it off of the registry because they got it from somewhere else, it was a newer model, etc.

This application offers an independent, flexible gift registry that allows users to create a list of items and define the specificity of each. For example, a user could add an item for "Tennis shoes, red, size 7", possibly with some links for inspiration, but other users are free to check off this item without having to buy a specific pair of shoes from a specific retailer. The user could also indicate that the item *must* be a specific item, and provide a like to the item. Links and descriptions are optional, which gives the users maximum flexibility.
